## üìê Mathematical Background

The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is a fundamental result in number theory that describes the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of linear congruences.

### The Theorem

If m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ, ..., m‚Çô are pairwise coprime positive integers, then the system of congruences:

```
x ‚â° a‚ÇÅ (mod m‚ÇÅ)
x ‚â° a‚ÇÇ (mod m‚ÇÇ)
‚ãÆ
x ‚â° a‚Çô (mod m‚Çô)
```

has a unique solution modulo M = m‚ÇÅ √ó m‚ÇÇ √ó ... √ó m‚Çô.

### Solution Method

The solution is given by:

```
x ‚â° (a‚ÇÅM‚ÇÅy‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇM‚ÇÇy‚ÇÇ + ... + a‚ÇôM‚Çôy‚Çô) (mod M)
```

where:
- M = m‚ÇÅ √ó m‚ÇÇ √ó ... √ó m‚Çô
- M·µ¢ = M / m·µ¢
- y·µ¢ is the modular multiplicative inverse of M·µ¢ modulo m·µ¢ (i.e., M·µ¢y·µ¢ ‚â° 1 (mod m·µ¢))

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm

The CRT implementation follows these steps:

1. Validate inputs and check if moduli are pairwise coprime
2. Calculate M (product of all moduli)
3. For each congruence:
   - Calculate M·µ¢ = M / m·µ¢
   - Find the modular multiplicative inverse of M·µ¢ modulo m·µ¢
   - Calculate the term a·µ¢ √ó M·µ¢ √ó inverse
4. Sum all terms and take modulo M to get the final result

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** with custom properties for styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for logic and DOM manipulation
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive layout and components
- **Bootstrap Icons** for iconography

### Key Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns**: Algorithm logic (crt.js) is separated from UI logic (app.js)
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using Bootstrap grid and custom media queries
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes for better accessibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works with minimal JS, enhanced features gracefully degrade
- **Dark Mode**: Implemented using CSS variables and data attributes
